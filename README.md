##### Fork status, contributing changes, etc.:
This is a fork from the last known state of the original repository, <github.com/bwRavencl/BLU-fx>.

The author of this fork is Steven L. Goldberg, who attempted to contribute these changes back
to the core project, however the Pull Request was denied due to the author claiming to have
abandoned the effort.  So, others are welcome to pick up from here and run with it if desired.

Therefore, please fork *this* repository instead of the original, and send PRs to `slgoldberg`.

Thanks!

##### Caveats

This version is currently only updated to build on Mac's Xcode development toolset.  The Makefile
has not been used or updated since these changes were last made. So building any other way except
on Mac using Xcode is left as an exercise to the reader. :-)
